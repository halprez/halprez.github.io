    "bio": "I am a Senior Software Engineer with 20+ years of field experience, currently specializing in distributed systems and AI technologies. I combine technical expertise with analytical curiosity, grounded in strong software engineering principles. I've been building software since I was 8 years old, so I feel incredibly fortunate to have turned a childhood passion into a fulfilling career. For me, coding isn't just work; it's a craft I continuously pursue. When not building software, I find clarity through yoga, meditation, chess, and outdoor adventures—practices I leverage to empower my day-to-day working activities.",
